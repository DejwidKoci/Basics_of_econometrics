# Basics_of_econometrics
Welcome to basic econometrics exercise project! Here, you'll find a collection of exercises that were conducted during my basic econometrics classes. These exercises cover a wide range of topics, including:
- calculate statistic measures
- significance testing of model parameters
- methods for selecting variables for the model
- testing the randomness of random components
- checking that the linear model is a good fit to the data
- checking for autocorrelation of random components
- testing the homoskedasticity of random components
- checkin multicollinearity
- building models with qualitative variables

We've leveraged a variety of Python modules to complete these tasks, including:

- pandas
- scipy
- numpy
- matplotlib
- statsmodels
