# T test
Here, we use t test to examine correlation between variables:  
$$H_0: r_{xy} \neq 0$$
$$H_1: r_{xy} = 0$$

The statistics are as follows:
$$t_{emp} = \frac{|r_{xy}|}{\sqrt{1-r_{xy}^2}}\sqrt{n-2}$$

Critical value of Student's t-test is eqal t-value from inverse distribution with a significance level of 0.05 and  n-2 degrees of freedom where n is a sample size.

If $t \geq t$*  then we have grounds to reject the null hypothesis (the value of the correlation coefficient is significantly different from zero).
